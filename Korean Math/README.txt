The story behind this one is simple. I saw a viral facebook post of a math problem that 8 year
olds in a korean village had to solve. (See included image) The rules are simple: fill in the 
boxes with numbers 1-9, using all, so that the equation is correct. I figured doing it by hand
would take too long, so I wrote this code instead.

(Note: There is more than one solution to this problem and the ":" is a divisor).
